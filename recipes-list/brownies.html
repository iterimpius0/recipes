    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. 
            These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what 
            you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>9 servings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz good-quality chocolate (225 g), semi-sweet</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups sugar (250 g)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour (95 g)</li>
            <li>¼ cup cocoa powder (30 g)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line an 8-inch (20 cm) 
            square baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate 
            in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other 
            half for later.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric 
            hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla for 1-2 minutes, 
            until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in color.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or 
            else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, 
            and salt. Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful 
            not to overmix as this will cause the brownies to be more 
            cake-like in texture.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter to the 
            prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your 
            brownies, then cool completely.</li>
        <li>Slice, then serve with a nice cold glass of milk!</li>
    </ol>
